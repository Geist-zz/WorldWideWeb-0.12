<H1>WorldWideWeb distributed code</H1>See also the CERN <A NAME=0 HREF=Copyright.html>copyright</A> . This directory ("hypertext") contains
information about hypertext, hypertext systems, and the WorldWideWeb
project. If you have taken this with a .tar file, you will have only
a subset of the files.
<H2>Documentation</H2>This directory and its sub-directories contain example hypertext.
The text is an extract of the text from the WorldWideWeb (WWW) project
documentation.<P>
The text is provided as example hypertext only, not for general distribution.
The accuracy of any information is not guaranteed, and no responsibility
will be accepted by the authors for any loss or damage due to inaccuracy
or omission.<P>
The information about the WWW project is internal project documentation
provided only to certain collaborators. It should not be copied or
distributed to others without the authority of the WWW team.<P>
This is a snapshot of a changing hypertext system. It is inevitably
out of date, and may be inconsistent.  There are links to information
which is not provided here.  If any of these facts cause a problem,
you should access the original master data over the network, or mail
us. Currently (Mar 91) network access requires you to be able to NFS
mount our files, which may only be done from specific nodes with permission.
In the future we shall make this information available via  anonymous
FTP or HTTP from the browsers.
<H2>Code</H2>The browser for the NeXT is those files contained in the application
directory WWW/Next/Implementation/WorldWideWeb.app and is compiled.<P>
The line Mode browser is in WWW/LineMode/Implementation/... (See <A NAME=1 HREF=WWW/LineMode/Installation.html>Installation
notes</A>)<P>
Subdirectories to that directory contain Makefiles for systems to
which we have already ported.  If your system is not among them, make
a new subdirectory with the system name, and copy the Makefile from
an existing one. Change the directory names as needed. PLEASE INFORM
US OF THE CHANGES WHEN YOU HAVE DONE THE PORT. This is a condidtion
of  your use of this code, and will save others repeating your work,
and save you repeating it in future releases.<P>
Whe you install the browsers,  remember to configure the default page.
This is /usr/local/lib/WWW/default.html for the line mode browser,
and .../WorldWideWeb.app/default.html for the NeXT browser. These
must point to some useful information!  You should keep them up to
date with pointers to info on your site and elsewhere.<P>
Most of the documentation is in hypertext, and so wil be readable
most easily with a browser...<P>
Your comments will of course be most appreciated. If you write your
own hypertext and make it available by anonymous ftp, tell us and
we'll put some pointers to it in ours. This way, the web spreads...
