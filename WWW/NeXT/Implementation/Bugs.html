<TITLE>Bug list for the WorldWideWeb application on the NeXT</TITLE>
<NEXTID 3>
<H1>Bug List - Wish List</H1>The following are noted problems with the <A NAME=0 HREF=../WorldWideWeb.html>WWW app on the NeXT</A> . See
also the list of <A NAME=1 HREF=Features.html>bug fixes and features</A> added.  These are the serious
bugs first:
<UL>
<LI>Typing in the middleof an anchor screws it up.
<LI>Inserting at beginning of paragraph get style of previous paragraph!
<LI>Saving a reference to a news article in an html file screws up the
address (adds a directory to it!)
<LI>Crash is news host not set up still?!
<LI>Plain text documents get wrong format. If no tags, then random format
used. Scrolling on plain text documents is wrong.
<LI>Highlighting  is not implemented. Any character highlighting is removed
from a file when it is saved (except that of the paragraph styles).
<LI>Quit doesn't check for unsaved files! 
</UL>
<H3>Here are the less serious ones:</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Supress anchors in printed document using stylesheet
<LI>The password given for anonymous FTP should have the actual user name,
not "user".
<LI>If (save) fails, then try (save as) to get, amongst other things,
path creation for the profile files.
<LI>Style editor does not  allow styles to be modified properly. 
<LI>Cutting and pasting anchors leaves them grey but strips them of their
anchor status. (This is because the "info" inormation is not copied
in to rtf. Can we extend rtf?).
<LI>"Less than" signs in the text are not escaped on save, so they will
be interpreted on reload of the file!  Don't put them into your file
except in XMP sections.
<LI>You can't put anchors into plain text files or plain text sections.
<LI>HyperText is not automatically resized when one resizes the window
with the mouse. 
</UL>
<H3>News:</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Reply 430 "article not available(?)" converted to "cannot contact
server". Must be more intelligent about different replies.  
<LI>Should try loading saved file instead of unavailable article.
</UL>
<H3>Improvements desirable:</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Dispense with the  SGML tag in stylesheets, or make stylesheet completely
SGML-oriented.
<LI>rtf or SGML for style sheet format.
<LI>File access: open directories as README plus file list - or open them
in the workspace?
<LI>Perhaps have selection of various blanks which one could use, for
annotations,  text sections, footnotes, etc.
<LI>A style menu with each style as an item
<LI>Automatically insert paragraph prefix when RETURN pushed in list,
delete when paragraph deleted.
</UL>
<H3>Not included yet but won't be missed yet:</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Link Typing. Link inspector in general:  see destination of link to
see why it doesn't work. Document inspector: allow editing of the
document title!
<LI>"Seen flag" -  hash table of all seen nodes. Link with .newsrc? Server-specific?
<LI>Annotate: Make unique message-id for file name, save locally if poss
else in user area. Use different template (note.html)
<LI>Format negociation.
<LI>Concept of a 32-bit pointer to a name in a hash table for such things
as style names, Format names, etc. Associated with a list of things
with that name. Is this a NXAtom?
<LI>Web traversal - Serialisation: Select by link type, depth, breadth/depth-first
order. Need this tracing to: Print, search by content, generate index,
generate SGML book, etc. 
<LI>Create the $(HOME)/WWW subdirectory if necessary.
<LI>Default styles held in program in case system styles don't exist.
<LI>Web checking: finding dangling links or links to things which have
disappeared. This is part of serialisation, I guess.
<LI>Journaling, Graphical overview</A>
</UL>
